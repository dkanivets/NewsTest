##test project
### Setup
To setup project simply clone repository and open **.xcworspace* file. All dependencies are commited to the repo to simplify project setup. However in real life example I would prefer to gitignore pods.

### Features

* I tried to follow *MVVM* architecture with usage of **ReactiveCocoa**

### What this app can do:

* get newsapi sources, filter them by category, country, language
* get artcicles for source
* show article details
